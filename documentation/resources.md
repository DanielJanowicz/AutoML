# Resources:

Here are the resources I used in order to assist with the development of this repo.

I utilized a [Sparcs dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hantswilliams/HHA-507-2022/main/autoML/datasets/data_sparcs.csv) by Hants Williams for the binary model.

I then used [heart data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csanicola74/AutoML-examples/main/data/heart.csv) by Caroline Sanicola for the classifier model.

Caroline Sanicola had assisted me on this repository.
